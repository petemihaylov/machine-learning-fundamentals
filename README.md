##  2021 Machine Learning
What its machine learning ?

> “The field of study that gives computers the ability to learn without
> being explicitly programmed” - Arthur Samuel

### Categories / Types of learning 

 - **Supervised** *( You have data and labels, the model tries to learn the relationship between the 	data and labels. )*
 - **Unsupervised** *(You have data but no labels)*
 - **Reinforcement** *( An agent **algorithm** performs actions in an enviroment and is rewarded or penalized based on the whether the actions were favourable or not.)*
 - **Transfer training** *( Take knowledge from one model and use it in your own)*


### Problems
 - Classification 
 - Regression 
 - Clustering 
 - Dimensional reduction
